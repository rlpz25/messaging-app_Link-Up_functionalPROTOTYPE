# Link-Up App Prototype.

Link-Up is an easy to use messagin app.

Difference between Link-Up and other messagin apps is that this one has the function to sort out messages, allowing user to navigate into different message classes, its objective is to make topic messages easier to find. User determines how topics are sorted by providing a class name to each.
